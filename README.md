# ece-7123-project-1-CIFAR-10-classification
This is the repository to store the code and report of the NYU ECE-7123 Project 1.

This project consisted on training a restricted ResNet on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with the goal of maximizing accuracy. The restriction is that the ResNet must have at most 5 million parameters.
Our model achieved 96% test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In order to run the model simply execute the Jupyter notebook file.
